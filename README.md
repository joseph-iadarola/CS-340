When writing sustainable code it is important to remember that somethings will not stay consistant such as login information, queries, current program versions, or other such examples. In these cases it is best to plan for the future and make the need for future changes less frequent and easier by keeping them separate as much as possible. An example of this is not hardcoding in login information or specific parameters when possible. By making these variables, future users will have an easier time finding spots that need to be changed. By using an external python file I found it easier that working in Jupyter Notebook because it was familiar and faster. In the future it the CRUD file could do more such as an initial filter of the data that is being passed back into the application so that for example Cats are not included in the initial data table. The CRUD file can also work with other similar projects with some editing to the database connection part of the code.
